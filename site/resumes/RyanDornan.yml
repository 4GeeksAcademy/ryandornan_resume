       At the age of 16 I decided I wanted to focus my education on music so moved from Scotland to Ireland. I spent the following years learning the art of electronic music production, recording studio tecniques and live sound engineering skiils and techniques. This led to me discovering my passion for live events and subsequently led to my next stage of education, events managment.

    - degree: Degree in Events Managemnet

        After completing my Music Technology I decided to use my knowledge of sound and technology to focus on the events industry and putting my skills to use. I enrolled in an Events Management degree whilst actively promoting events and working with local brands. In the final term of my first year I was approached by Ireland's longest running nightclub and asked to join their events team. I found my course slow and it lacked the real world, practical experience I wanted so, after much deliberation, decided real world experience would be most beneficial for my career. A decision that I have never regretted and brought me to where I am today.
